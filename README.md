### Access

In the readme files for each project, you'll find a link to view each project online.<br><br>
In this repo you'll find the Jupyter notebooks and html versions.<br><br>
The datasets for these projects are in the [folder](https://github.com/daiichigo/Analytics/tree/main/datasets) above.

In [Statistical Data Analysis](https://github.com/daiichigo/Analytics/blob/main/readme_Statistical_DataAnalysis_AB_Test.md) there are analyses of user activity and activity by date, as well as conversion analysis and statistical analysis of AB testing.
