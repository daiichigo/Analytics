# Analytics

The analytics work I've done in this repo is coded with the following:

* In [Statistical Data Analysis](https://github.com/daiichigo/Analytics/blob/main/readme_Statistical_DataAnalysis_AB_Test.md) there are analyses of user activity and activity by date, as well as conversion analysis and statistical analysis of AB testing.

* In [Machine Learning Forecast](https://github.com/daiichigo/Analytics/blob/main/readme_ML_Forecast_Predictive_Analytics.md), classification models are trained and K-Means clustering demonstrated, along with feature analysis and customer churn behavior analysis.

* In [Performance Metrics Analysis](https://github.com/daiichigo/Analytics/blob/main/readme_Performance_Metrics_Analysis_for_VirtualTelephony_Operator_Efficiency.md), efficiency metrics for virtual telephony operators are determined and analyzed. The virtual operators are segmented based on performance on selected metrics and relative performance is evaluated by metrics and by date. Statistical testing is conducted to confirm the efficacy of segmentation.

* The [SQL Analysis](https://github.com/daiichigo/Analytics/blob/main/SQL_Analysis_Book_Startup_Database_.ipynb) relies on joins and subqueries in PostgreSQL to explore five tables in a publishing database on behalf of a startup forming a bookselling business venture.
