ML Model Forecast & Feature Analysis: Predictive Analytics

This is an analysis of a dataset compiled from the customer records of a chain of gyms. The chain is developing a customer interaction strategy based on this data. The goal is to devise a customer retention strategy based on an analysis of customers who churn and those who stay.

This analysis to fortify the chainâ€™s customer retention strategy includes:
* Portraits of Loyal Customers and Customers who Churn 
* ML classification model based on two algorithms: Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression 
* K-Means Clustering
* Feature Analysis
* Churn reduction measures 

An html version and a Jupyter notebook of this Forecast & Analysis are in the main branch of this repository. The gym customer record dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/daiichigo/Analytics/blob/main/datasets/gym_churn_us.csv)
