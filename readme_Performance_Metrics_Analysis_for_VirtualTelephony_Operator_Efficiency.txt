The purpose of this analysis is to ferret out the ineffective operators from this virtual telephony enterprise. 
Operator data is contained in the calls dataset, the focus of this analysis: telecom_dataset_us.csv  
Efficiency metrics are determined and analyzed. 
Operators are segmented based on performance on the selected metrics. Relative performance is evaluated based on these segments. Statistical hypothesis testing is undertaken to evaluate segmentation schemes. 
Operator performance is also analyzed in the context of the time frame in which the data was gathered. 

An html version and a Jupyter notebook of this analysis are in the main branch of this repository. The two telecom datasets can be found in the dataset branch.
