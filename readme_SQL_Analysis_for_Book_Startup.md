SQL Analysis: Book Startup Database

This database contains tables of books, publishers, authors, reviews and customer ratings. A startup developing an app catering to bibliophiles is seeking to forge a value proposition.

Questions posed by the startup will be addressed in SQL queries about publishers, authors, publication dates, reviews and ratings, including pinpointing the leading publisher issuing books longer than 50 pages and the single author corralling the best ratings of all books with more than 50 ratings.
