Online Store Conversion: AB Testing Analysis

This analysis covers user behavior at an online retailer.

The relevant data encompass three datasets: one for grouping participants in the AB tests, one for events that users of the website engaged in and one for enrollment information about each participant.

The AB test assesses whether users improve their conversion rates within 14 days of their first visit to the site. A is the control group. B is the test group, comprised of users exposed to an improved recommendation system.

After initial analysis of the data, there are analyses of user activity and activity by date, as well as conversion analysis and statistical analysis of the AB test.
